# COMP4442-Project
This is a PolyU COMP 4442 project to design a web service based on Spark SQL.

## Objective
As an important part of an intelligent transportation system, driving behavior analysis helps us to identify dangerous driving scenarios to avoid traffic accidents. The project is to develop a website for driver behavior analysis.

## Goals
The website should support the following functions: 
a) Generate a summary to show the driving behavior of each driver. 
b) Monitor the driving speed of each driver in real-time.
